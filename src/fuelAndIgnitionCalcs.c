/** @brief Fuel and ignition calculations
 *
 * Using a variety of primary algorithms calculate a base pulsewidth and then
 * apply various corrections to it such as injector dead time, transient fuel
 * correction, engine temperature enrichment and per cylinder trims. The fuel
 * injection timing is also determined here.
 *
 * Calculate the ignition timing and dwell here too. Several corrections are
 * applied to these as well.
 *
 * @todo TODO change the way configuration is done and make sure the most common options are after the first if().
 * @todo TODO add actual configuration options to the fixed config blocks for these items.
