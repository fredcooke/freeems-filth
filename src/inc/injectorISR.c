/**	@file injectorISR.c
 *
 * @brief Injector ISR shared code
 *
 * This code is identical between all 6 channels, and thus we only want one
 * copy of it. The X in each macro will be replaced with the number that is
 * appropriate for the channel it is being used for at the time.
 *
 * Each channel performs the following actions
 *
 * - 1	Clear its interrupt flag
 * - 2	Record its start time
 * - 3	Measure and record its latency
 * - 4	Check to see if its just turned on
 *   - 4.1	Copy the channels pulse width to a local variable
 *   - 4.2	Determine the minimum pulse width based on code run time const and latency
 *   - 4.3	Clamp used pulsewidth inside min and max
 *   - 4.4	If used pulse width is larger than the current period of the engines cycle flag as always on
 *   - 4.5	Set the action to turn off
 *   - 4.6	Increment the time by pulse width
 *   - 4.7	If staging required, either, switch them on and sched to turn off, or sched to turn on
 * - 5	Else it has just turned off
 *   - 5.1	If staged channel is still on, turn it off
 *   - 5.2	If(self schedule flagged) schedule the next start
 *   - 5.3	Else disable itself
 * - 6	Calculate and record code run time
 * - 7	Return
 *
