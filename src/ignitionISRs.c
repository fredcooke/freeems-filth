 * @brief Turn ignition channels on and off
 *
 * As of 6am 25/4/11 nzst this file has been stripped and de-commissioned.
 *
 * This currently semi-working but broken code is intended to one day provide
 * multi-channel ignition capabilities. The basic method will be to turn a pin
 * or set of pins on or another pin or set of pins off during each run of the
 * appropriate handler. Each run will be triggered either by the scheduler and
 * possibly this code itself as well. Currently it does not work correctly and
 * isn't suitable for actual use as an ignition control solution.

/* Summary of intended ignition timing scheme
 *
 * Set TWO PIT timers based on a reference point (probably single cam trigger or optionally toggle bit based on missing tooth on crank)
 * Arm one PIT timer interrupt to trigger when we need to start dwelling
 * Arm the other PIT timer interrupt to trigger when we need to fire
 * Configure a variable to point to the next pin to turn on for dwell
 * Configure a variable to point to the next pin to turn off to fire
 * On PIT interrupt for dwell check to see that spark should have finished
 * If so, turn on coil to dwell
 * If not, reset dwell timer interrupt for end of spark event
 * On PIT interrupt for spark, turn off coil (amything else?)
 * Repeat for each cylinder.
 */

/* Further consideration to spark duration and dwell starting possibly needs to be done. */
