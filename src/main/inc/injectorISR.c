/** @file
 *
 * @brief Injector ISR shared code
 *
 * This code is identical between all 6 channels, and thus we only want one
 * copy of it. The X in each macro will be replaced with the number that is
 * appropriate for the channel it is being used for at the time.
 *
 * Each channel performs the following actions
 *
 * - 1  Clear its interrupt flag
 * - 2  Record its start time
 * - 3  Measure and record its latency
 * - 4  Check to see if its just turned on
 *   - 4.1  Copy the channels pulse width to a local variable
 *   - 4.2  Determine the minimum pulse width based on code run time const and latency
 *   - 4.3  Clamp used pulsewidth inside min and max
 *   - 4.4  If used pulse width is larger than the current period of the engines cycle flag as always on
 *   - 4.5  Set the action to turn off
 *   - 4.6  Increment the time by pulse width
 *   - 4.7  If staging required, either, switch them on and sched to turn off, or sched to turn on
 * - 5  Else it has just turned off
 *   - 5.1  If staged channel is still on, turn it off
 *   - 5.2  If(self schedule flagged) schedule the next start
 *   - 5.3  Else disable itself
 * - 6  Calculate and record code run time
 * - 7  Return
 *
 * @see injectionISRs.c
