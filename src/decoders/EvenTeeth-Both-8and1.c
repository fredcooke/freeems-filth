 *
 * @brief For evenly spaced teeth on the camshaft with a single second input.
 *
 * This is suitable for engines such as the Yamaha R1 with 8 teeth on the crank
 * and equally for something with 16 on the cam. Sync is provided by the second
 * input allowing a sequential and/or COP/CNP setup to be used.
