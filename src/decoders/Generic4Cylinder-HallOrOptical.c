 * @brief Echos the input on the first ignition output
 *
 * This decoder is for any 4 tooth/slot hall or optical cam speed sensor and to
 * be used for distributor and/or 4 shot batch injection only.
 *
 * To build a version of this decoder with a specific angle pair for your hall
 * or optical distributor, just define the DECODER_IMPLEMENTATION_C flag,
 * include the four required headers, define the angle for E1, and define the
 * unique decoder name string!
 *
 * To effectively reverse the polarity, just subtract your angle from 180 and
 * it will then be correct, assuming that either angle is correct.
